# Study App - Smart Study Hub

**Study App** is a premium, full-stack, production-ready study management application designed for students and educators. Built using React on the frontend, Node.js + Express on the backend, and MongoDB for database persistence, it provides a comprehensive workspace to organize courses, track targets, sketch on an interactive whiteboard, write rich notes in markdown, and manage study documents.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Authentication Flow (JWT-secured)**
   - Secure Register and Login portals using email and password.
   - Encrypted passwords via `bcryptjs` on the server.
   - Authentication tokens (JSON Web Tokens) stored locally in `localStorage`.
   - Complete route protection in React Router v6 (redirects to `/login` if unauthenticated) and pre-configured Axios interceptors injecting auth headers.

2. **Course Management Dashboard**
   - High-fidelity visual cards for each course.
   - Overall target completion progress bars dynamically calculated and animated based on checklists.
   - Modern course creation modal and cascading deletions (removes targets, whiteboard sketches, notes, document lists, and deletes stored files from the server).

3. **Tab 1: Targets & Goals Hub**
   - Interactive, checklist-based learning milestones.
   - Toggle completion status with instant visual updates.
   - Responsive overall course completion progress bar at the top of the course.

4. **Tab 2: Whiteboard Sketchpad**
   - Freehand responsive drawing canvas using HTML5 Canvas inside React.
   - Advanced tools: Custom Pen brush, Size Slider (2px - 20px), Eraser (using destination-out operations to erase actual strokes regardless of background color), Canvas Clear with warnings, and Undo action to pop the last stroke.
   - **Autosave Engine**: Automatically serializes canvas drawings as JSON and auto-saves to MongoDB on mouseup/mouseleave, displaying custom cloud sync indicators ("Syncing..." and "Saved").

5. **Tab 3: Course Notes Markdown Workspace**
   - Split-screen workspace on desktop (Editor on the left, rendered output on the right) with tabbed selectors for mobile screens.
   - **Custom regex Markdown-to-HTML parser**: Translates headings (`#`, `##`, `###`), bold (`**`), italic (`*`), dividers (`---`), bullet points, checklist items (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`), inline code, and fenced code blocks into responsive, styled components with zero heavy dependencies!
   - **Autosave Engine**: Debounces writing changes, auto-saving note content to MongoDB 1.2 seconds after you stop typing. Includes an interactive formatting cheatsheet guide.

6. **Tab 4: Study Documents Manager**
   - Interactive file drag-and-drop zone with size limits (up to 15MB).
   - Backend file handling powered by **Multer**, storing uploads in local server storage (`/server/uploads`).
   - Dynamic file extension mapping to distinct custom icons (PDFs, Word docs, Images, Scripts, Zips, others).
   - **Secure JWT File Downloads**: Feeds the download binary stream via Axios as a blob (ensures files can never be accessed without a valid auth token) and triggers dynamic browser downloads preserving the original uploaded file name.
   - Cascading deletions purging database metadata and removing files from server disks.

7. **Theme & Responsiveness**
   - Full dark/light mode toggle with preferences saved in `localStorage`.
   - Glassmorphic panels, glowing focus states, Outfit typography, and dynamic animations.
   - Beautiful loaders/spinners and rich Empty State blocks.
   - Real-time success and error toast notifications using `react-hot-toast`.

## ⚙️ Local Setup Guide

### Prerequisites
- Make sure you have **Node.js** (v18 or higher recommended) and **npm** installed.
- Ensure **MongoDB** is running locally on your system (`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`) or have a MongoDB Atlas connection URI ready.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (or navigate to the workspace directory):
   ```bash
   cd "student dashboard"
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies** (installs root, client, and server packages concurrently):
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
   *(Alternatively, you can run `npm install` inside the root, `cd server && npm install`, and `cd client && npm install` manually.)*

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - The `/server` directory contains a pre-configured `.env` file pointing to a local MongoDB instance.
   - If you need to make changes (e.g. point to MongoDB Atlas or modify ports), update the values in `/server/.env` matching the `/package.json` setup:
     ```env
     PORT=5000
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/studyapp
     JWT_SECRET=supersecretjwtkey12345!
     ```

### 🚀 Running the Application

To run the backend server and frontend React client concurrently in development mode, run the following command from the **root folder**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This launches:
- **Express Backend Server** on `http://localhost:5000`
- **Vite React Client** on `http://localhost:3000` (which automatically proxies requests to `/api` directly to port `5000`).

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your web browser, register your account, and start managing your learning journey!
